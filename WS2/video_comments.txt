3.1

Race condition:
- Open https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition and show things on 
example.
Race conditions occur when two or more threads try to access the same 
variable 
and change it at the same time.
For example: 2 threads have the task of reading a value from the 
variable, 
increasing it and writing it back to the same variable. We can 
see from this table that the threads both read the value of 
variable before the thread that started reading it is finished 
with increasing and overwriting. That results in a wrong result which should 
be 2, not 1.


Deadlock:
- Show picture https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock#/media/File:Process_deadlock.svg 
and explain.

Deadlock is a situation when 2 or more threads are waiting for 
each other to finish.
Example:
Thread 1 is updating Row 1 and wants to continue on updating Row 2.
Thread 2 is at the same time updating Row 2 and wants to continue on 
updating Row 2. Now, Thread 1 can't proceed to Row 2 since Thread 2 is 
hold on Row 2 because it wants to proceed to Row 1. Both threads are  
in hold and nothing is going to happen, meaning, we have a deadlock 
going on.

Heisenbug:

Heisenbugs appear when someone tries to debug the code with putting some 
additional output statements or similiar lines to the code, and the 
program suddenly starts acting in a different way. That usually happnes 
because such lines change the memory addresses and the timing of execution. 
One of the examples is also removing the compilation flag which results 
in some values being stored in memory instead of register.

Floating-point arithmetic challenge:

Comparisons
http://floating-point-gui.de/errors/comparison/

When we compare two floating-point numbers we have to be careful. If 
they are very close together it matters how they were constructed. In 
this example over here we can see that both floates, a and b are 0.3, 
but the way they were calculated is different. The rounding errors are 
also different meaning, that if we compare a and b, we can get an 
unexpected result of A not being equal to B.

Definition of a zero and signed zeros

By one of the IEEE standards the zero representation in floating point 
arithmetics is done with help of a signed zero, which yields that a 0 
has 
a sign (+ or -). The exact 0 is usually represented as +0, but can also 
be represented with -0. Within the floating-point arithmetics we can 
never know whether something equals exactly 0. That's why engineers 
defined signed zero based on analogy of approaching 0 from below or 
above limit.

Cancellation or loss of significance
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_significance (Demonstration of the 
problem)

Loss of significance can be explained with subtracting two fairly close 
numbers. Let's define the first number and the second one. The second 
number is represented on a machine that keeps 10 floating-point digits, 
while the first is represented on a machine that keeps more than 10 
digits. Let's firstly subtract the numbers on a more precise machine and 
then on the 10-digits based one. We can observe that the results are 
much different and that can cause many problems when we try to obtain 
the correct results in our code.


Amplification and error propagation

When we use ill-posed operations such as subtraction and addition, we 
make an error if the numbers of different magnitudes are used. 
The more such ill-posed calculations that we use with one number, the 
more the error amplifies at the end.

Session Manager
- open the manager and talk -

The session manager provides the ability to add, delete and edit a 
debugging session or to resume/start it.


Root Window
In the root window, we can observe all of the ranks, check their status and see which processes belong to them.

Process Window
The process window provide a lot of subwindows. However, it is the process window is the main point of observation.
The stack trace pane consists of list of functions that are being called, ordered by the trace.
The stack frame pane shows the values of local variables or registers, depending on what do we observe. It provides both, hexadecimal and decimal forms.
In the source pane we can observe the source code or the binary. We can also set where do we want to stop at.
The action points tab is a list of all of the points where we want to stop and debug something.
The processes tab provides a possibility of putting a scope on a specific rank. All of the values in all of the windows are then changed based on that.
The threads pane lists all of the threads of the rank chosen in the processes tab. Again, we can see what a specific thread is doing.

Variable window
It is issued with the letter v. Variable window is a tool which helps us 
to search for a certain object and observe its value. 
It also allows us to change the variable's value or to cast it.
